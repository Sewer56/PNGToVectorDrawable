# PNGToVectorDrawable
Bash PNG Tracing Script that converts PNGs to SVG and VectorDrawable (with transparency support).

This is for personal use and therefore not the most user friendly, nor professional, rushed infact. Settings can be found at the beginning of the script, just open it up in a text editor, files can be converted either separately or in batch, enjoy.
